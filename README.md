# yosh

an interactive shell based on [yavascript](https://github.com/suchipi/yavascript). A marriage of a traditional interactive shell and a JavaScript repl.

## Concept

The Dreamâ„¢ is that you can treat the prompt as either a normal shell prompt or a JavaScript REPL, and it will understand your intent in either case and behave accordingly.

## Project Status

Proof-of-concept/twinkle-in-my-eye. It's functional, but you probably wouldn't enjoy using it as your actual shell.
